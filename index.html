	<p>I woke came to school. I went to first and second period and got lots of work done. After second period I walked to my 5th period class to get ready for the archer Malmo field trip. I put up my backpack and the rest of my belongings in my teacher class room, After I put up my things I waited for my friend to set his things down so we could walk to the meeting spot where everyone supposed to go before we got on the bus</p>

	<p>As we where walking to the main building we where talking about football and how his team couldnâ€™t beat my favorite NFL team. As we where standing in the main building waiting for the our bus to come pick us up everyone was talking and having fun, I even took a couple pictures with some of my close friends as we where waiting for the bus. </p>

	<p>When the bus arrived me and my friends ran to the bus before everyone else got there so we could get a good seat in the back of the bus where everybody likes to sit. As we was on the bus on the way to the archer Malmo everyone was communicating and laughing, just playing around. While I was on the bus I was listing to my music and playing a game on my phone into we got to our destination. As we arrived to the place everyone was so excited to get off the bus to go inside the place to learn more about coding and etc. </p>

	<p>The bus driver had to park like a block or 2 down from the building. So as we got off the bus we had to walk down some to enter the lace. While we was walking to the place we all where playing around laughing and very happy. As we entered the place it was so clean and smelled very nice. A man came up to us so he could show us around and talk to us  about how everything work. Before we got started we all had to go up stairs on the elevator. </p>
	<p>We had to go a couple people at a time to get to the next floor. When everybody was seated in the room on the next floor a man was telling us about how they make they websites. After a while I fell asleep and missed half of what he was telling us. As I was sleep my classmates where recording me because I was knocked out lol. When I woke up they showed me videos of me sleeping and everyone plus me where laughing.</p>

	<p>We than went to the bottom floor to see where they record for like plays and etc. After they explained how everything works we left and walked to get back on the bus. We where all standing outside on the corner waiting for the bus to pull back up</p>
	<p>When she arrived everyone rushed on the bus because it was so cold and we went to cook out afterwards we went back to the school and went home.</p>
